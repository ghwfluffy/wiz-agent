# Agent Runtime

The agent runtime is intentionally bounded. Models can interpret language and
propose actions, but deterministic host code owns state and side effects.

## Model Tiers

Model names are configuration, not business logic. The app uses these logical
tiers:

- `fast`: default simple tasks.
- `smart`: stronger reasoning or synthesis.
- `orchestrator`: short planning runs for complex work.
- `repair`: JSON/tool argument repair.

Admin configuration will eventually choose concrete OpenAI model IDs for each
tier.

## Tool Contracts

Tool contracts are Zod schemas in code. Model outputs are validated before tool
execution. Invalid tool arguments may go through a bounded repair call that gets
the malformed payload, expected contract shape, and validation errors.

## Host-Owned Controls

The host owns:

- tenant and user scope;
- credentials;
- persistence;
- task scheduling;
- tool permissions;
- approval checks;
- idempotency;
- retries and budgets;
- audit logging.

The model must not receive secrets or raw credential references.
